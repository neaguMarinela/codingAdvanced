        // Bills store.

        // bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that
        // the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items gets charged an additional

        // burger and all the additions).
        // This burger has a base price and the additions are all separately priced.
        // Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
