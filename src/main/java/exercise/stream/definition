Write a method that returns a comma separated string based on a given
list of integers.
Each element should be preceded by the letter 'e' if the number is even,
and preceded by the letter 'o' if the number is odd.
For example, if the input list is (3,44,5,10), the output should
be 'o3,e44,o5,e10'.

Note: Java 8 Lambdas and Streams for solution.
Use 'collect(joining...' to delimit by comma
